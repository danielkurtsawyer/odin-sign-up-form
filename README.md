# odin-sign-up-form
Github repository for the sign-up form project in the Odin Project's intermediate HTML and CSS course

A live demo of this site can be found here: https://danielkurtsawyer.github.io/odin-sign-up-form/.

This project involved the use of inputs, which were introduced in the most recent lessons. 
In order to ensure a responsive webpage, I used flexbox as well as relative text sizes to provide a clean look even when the window is resized.
